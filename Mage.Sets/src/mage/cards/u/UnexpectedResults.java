/**
 * Gatecrash FAQ 01/2013
 *
 * If you reveal a nonland card, you may cast it during the resolution of
 * Unexpected Results. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type.
 * Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat,"
 * must be followed.
 *
 * If you can't cast the card (perhaps because there are no legal targets), or
 * if you choose not to, the card will remain on top of the library.
 *
 * If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative
 * costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker
 * costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
 *
 * If the card has X Mana in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
 *
 * If you reveal a land card, Unexpected Results will be returned to your hand
 * only if you put that land card onto the battlefield. If you don't, Unexpected
 * Results will be put into its owner's graveyard.
 *
 * If you reveal a land card and put that card onto the battlefield, Unexpected
 * Results will be put into its owner's hand directly from the stack. It won't
 * be put into any graveyard.

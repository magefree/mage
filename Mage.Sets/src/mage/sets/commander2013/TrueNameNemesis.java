/**
 * Protection from a player is a new variant of the protection ability. It means
 * the following: -- True-Name Nemesis can’t be the target of spells or
 * abilities controlled by the chosen player. -- True-Name Nemesis can’t be
 * enchanted by Auras or equipped by Equipment controlled by the chosen player.
 * (The same is true for Fortifications controlled by the chosen player, if
 * True-Name Nemesis becomes a land.) -- True-Name Nemesis can’t be blocked by
 * creatures controlled by the chosen player. -- All damage that would be dealt
 * to True-Name Nemesis by sources controlled by the chosen player is prevented.
 * (The same is true for sources owned by the chosen player that don’t have
 * controllers.)

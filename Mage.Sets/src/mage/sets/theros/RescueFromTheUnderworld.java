/**
 *
 * Once you announce you’re casting Rescue from the Underworld, no player may
 * attempt to stop you from casting the spell by removing the creature you want
 * to sacrifice.
 *
 * If you sacrifice a creature token to cast Rescue from the Underworld, it
 * won’t return to the battlefield, although the target creature card will.
 *
 * If either the sacrificed creature or the target creature card leaves the
 * graveyard before the delayed triggered ability resolves during your next
 * upkeep, it won’t return.
 *
 * However, if the sacrificed creature is put into another public zone instead
 * of the graveyard, perhaps because it’s your commander or because of another
 * replacement effect, it will return to the battlefield from the zone it went
 * to.
 *
 * Rescue from the Underworld is exiled as it resolves, not later as its delayed
 * trigger resolves.

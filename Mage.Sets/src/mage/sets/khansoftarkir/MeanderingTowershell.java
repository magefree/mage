/**
 * As Meandering Towershell returns to the battlefield because of the delayed
 * triggered ability, you choose which opponent or opposing planeswalker it’s
 * attacking. It doesn’t have to attack the same opponent or opposing
 * planeswalker that it was when it was exiled.
 *
 * If Meandering Towershell enters the battlefield attacking, it wasn’t declared
 * as an attacking creature that turn. Abilities that trigger when a creature
 * attacks, including its own triggered ability, won’t trigger.
 *
 * On the turn Meandering Towershell attacks and is exiled, raid abilities will
 * see it as a creature that attacked. Conversely, on the turn Meandering
 * Towershell enters the battlefield attacking, raid abilities will not.
 *
 * If you attack with a Meandering Towershell that you don’t own, you’ll control
 * it when it returns to the battlefield.

/**
 * Mock class to override AI logic for test, cause PlayerImpl uses inner calls for other methods. If you
 * want to override that methods for tests then call it here.
 * <p>
 * It's a workaround and can be bugged (if you catch overflow error with new method then TestPlayer
 * class must re-implement full method code without computerPlayer calls).
 * <p>
 * Example 1: TestPlayer's code uses outer computerPlayer call to discard but discard's inner code must call choose from TestPlayer
 * Example 2: TestPlayer's code uses outer computerPlayer call to flipCoin but flipCoin's inner code must call flipCoinResult from TestPlayer
 * <p>
 * Don't forget to add new methods in another classes like TestComputerPlayer7 or TestComputerPlayerMonteCarlo

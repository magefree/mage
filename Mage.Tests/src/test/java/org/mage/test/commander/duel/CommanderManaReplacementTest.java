     * This issue appears to arise in both Commander Two Player Duel and
     * Commander Free For All. Whenever a player (call her player 1) controls a
     * permanent with a mana doubling continuous effect (e.g. Mana Flare) and
     * another player (call her player 2) taps an affected permanent for mana
     * that is outside of player 1's color identity, player 2 gets an additional
     * colorless mana rather than the correct color of mana. I suspect the
     * reason for this is that Xmage is treating Mana Flare as producing mana of
     * the appropriate color and adding it to another player's mana pool, which
     * is both incorrect in the game rules and would cause this problem.
     *
     * For example, I am playing a mono red deck and control a Mana Flare. You
     * are playing a mono green deck and you tap a Forest for mana. You should
     * add GG, but instead, Xmage shows you adding 1G to your
     * mana pool.

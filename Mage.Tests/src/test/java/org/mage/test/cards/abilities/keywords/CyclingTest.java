     * 702.28. Cycling
     *  702.28a Cycling is an activated ability that functions only while the card with cycling is in a player’s hand. 
     *          “Cycling [cost]” means “[Cost], Discard this card: Draw a card.”
     *  702.28b Although the cycling ability is playable only if the card is in a player’s hand, it continues to exist
     *          while the object is in play and in all other zones. Therefore objects with cycling will be affected by
     *          effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.
     *  702.28c Some cards with cycling have abilities that trigger when they’re cycled. “When you cycle [this card]” means
     *          “When you discard [this card] to pay a cycling cost.” These abilities trigger from whatever zone the card 
     *          winds up in after it’s cycled.
     *  702.28d Typecycling is a variant of the cycling ability. “[Type]cycling [cost]” means “[Cost], Discard this card:
     *          Search your library for a [type] card, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library.” 
     *          This type is usually a subtype (as in “mountaincycling”) but can be any card type, subtype, supertype, or
     *          combination thereof (as in “basic landcycling”).
     *  702.28e Typecycling abilities are cycling abilities, and typecycling costs are cycling costs. Any cards that trigger
     *          when a player cycles a card will trigger when a card is discarded to pay a typecycling cost. Any effect that
     *          stops players from cycling cards will stop players from activating cards’ typecycling abilities. Any effect
     *          that increases or reduces a cycling cost will increase or reduce a typecycling cost.

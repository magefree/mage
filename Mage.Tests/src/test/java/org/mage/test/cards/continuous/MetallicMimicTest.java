     * Additionally, if you play a Mimic naming, for example, "Dwarf", then if
     * you play a second Mimic also naming "Dwarf", the second Mimic won't enter
     * with a counter. Going by 616.2 in the Comp Rules, the second one should
     * be getting a counter as long as you name the same type as the first one.
     *
     * 611.3c Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so
     * simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. They don't
     * wait until the permanent is on the battlefield and then change it.
     * Because such effects apply as the permanent enters the battlefield, they
     * are applied before determining whether the permanent will cause an
     * ability to trigger when it enters the battlefield. #
     *
     * Example: A permanent with the static ability “All white creatures get
     * +1/+1” is on the battlefield. A creature spell that would normally create
     * a 1/1 white creature instead creates a 2/2 white creature. The creature
     * doesn't enter the battlefield as 1/1 and then change to 2/2.

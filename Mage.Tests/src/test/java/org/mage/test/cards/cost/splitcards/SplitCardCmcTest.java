    /**
    * The core of the change is that we're no longer assuming split cards have two sets of characteristics
    * when they're not on the stack. Some characteristics have multiple pieces of information very naturally
    * â€”Destined to Lead is an instant sorcery, the same as Ornithopter is an artifact creature. It's black and green
    * just like Winding Constrictor because its mana cost has B and G in it. Continuing that, the mana cost combines
    * the components, and a card asking for Destined to Lead's mana cost sees 4BG.
    *
    * So now, the converted mana cost question is simple: if Destined to Lead isn't on the stack, it has a converted mana cost
    * of 6. Destined on the stack is still a black instant with a converted mana cost of 2, and Lead on the stack is still a
    * green sorcery with a converted mana cost of 4, but Destined to Lead, any time it's not one or the other, is a black and green
    * instant sorcery with a converted mana cost of 6.

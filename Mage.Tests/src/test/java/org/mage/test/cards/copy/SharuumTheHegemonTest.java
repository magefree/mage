     * My Sharuum EDH deck uses the standard Sharuum + Clone Effect + Blood Artist as one of the win 
     * conditions, but when I have Sharuum in plan and play a Clever Impersonator, targetting Sharuum 
     * and choose to keep the Clever Impersonator and send the original Sharuum to the graveyard Xmage 
     * never gives me the option to use the Sharuum Ability that the Clever Impersonator should get, 
     * making the combo not work.
     * 
     * I run a Sharuum EDH deck that wins by cloning Sharuum for infinite death triggers. I know the rules 
     * check out on this combo irl, but no matter how I stack the triggers for cloning Sharuum and her enter
     * the battlefield effect it does not work. It either ends with Sharuum in my graveyard or the reanimate
     * effect hits the stack before the legend rule applies
     * 
        [1] Sharuum the Hegemon is on the battlefield.
        [2] You cast Clone (or any other Clone-like card).
        [3] When Clone resolves, you choose Sharuum for the replacement effect.
        [4] Since fake-Sharuum entered the battlefield, its EtB ability triggers.
        [5] State-based actions are checked and you are prompted to keep one Sharuum. You sacrifice real-Sharuum.
            * 116.2a Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, including while a spell is being cast, an ability is being activated, or a spell or
            * ability is resolving. (See rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities.") However, nothing actually happens at the time an ability triggers. 
            * Each time a player would receive priority, each ability that has triggered but hasn't yet been put on the stack is put on the stack. See rule 116.5
            * 116.5. Each time a player would get priority, the game first performs all applicable state-based actions as a single event (see rule 704,
            * "State-Based Actions"), then repeats this process until no state-based actions are performed. Then triggered abilities are put on the stack
            * (see rule 603, "Handling Triggered Abilities"). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based actions are performed and no abilities
            * trigger. Then the player who would have received priority does so.
        [6] Once State-based actions are finished, triggered abilities go on the stack. You put the EtB from [4] choosing real-Sharuum.
        [7] Real-Sharuum enters the battlefield.
        [8] Rinse and repeat.

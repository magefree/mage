     * Cards involved: Nourishing Shoal, Goryo's Vengeance, Griselbrand,
     * Terminate
     *
     * I actually noticed this bug on the 1.4.3 client, but I didn't see it in
     * the change log for 1.4.4, so I assume it is still unknown. Also, it is a
     * bit of a rules corner case and I haven't seen anyone else report it, so
     * the players of this deck may actually not realize it's incorrect.
     *
     * The scenario was that I cast a Nourishing Shoal with a Goryo's Vengeance
     * spliced to it targeting Griselbrand in my graveyard and exiling
     * Worldspine Wurm. My opponent responded with a Snapcaster Mage, so to
     * deprive him of his ability to reuse his counterspell, I cast the Goryo's
     * Vengeance on the Griselbrand. This one resolved. He then used Terminate
     * on the Griselbrand after I had activated it once. When the Shoal tried to
     * resolve, it should have been countered due to no legal target. However,
     * it caused me to gain 11 life. It did not resurrect Griselbrand
     * (correctly), but it should have done nothing at all.
     *
     * I include the info about the Terminate because thinking through, it could
     * be pertinent. I would guess what is going on here is one of two things.
     * Either the client doesn't recognize the Shoal with a spliced Vengeance as
     * a spell with a single target (because Shoal normally doesn't have a
     * target) or because the Griselbrand ended up back in the graveyard before
     * the Shoal tried to resolve, the client thought its target was still
     * valid. I lean toward the former since the Shoal/Vengeance properly failed
     * to resurrect the now dead again Griselbrand, so I don't think it was
     * reading that as the target, but I'm not certain. I will try to reproduce
     * the error against a bot and update this report.

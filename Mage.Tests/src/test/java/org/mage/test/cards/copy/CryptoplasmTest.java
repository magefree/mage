     * damage are now 8, since it was that exact damage that put him at 25
     * life), but even more confusing is how the Serra Avenger, which is a 3/3,
     * somehow kills my 4/4 that had suffered no other damage that turn.

     * No other permanents in play at that moment had any influence in this

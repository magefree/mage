     * Not to be a bother, but I posted earlier about how Zada, Hedron Grinder
     * 's interaction with splice is broken. I didn't get a response on whether
     * or not the problem was being looked at. Zada SHOULD copy spliced effects
     * (and currently doesn't) because spliced effects are put onto the spell
     * before it is cast and therefore before Zada's ability triggers, e.g.
     * Desperate Ritual spliced onto Into the Fray should generate 3 red mana
     * for every creature i control.
     *
     * 702.46a Splice is a static ability that functions while a card is in your
     * hand. “Splice onto [subtype] [cost]” means “You may reveal this card from
     * your hand as you cast a [subtype] spell. If you do, copy this card's text
     * box onto that spell and pay [cost] as an additional cost to cast that
     * spell.” Paying a card's splice cost follows the rules for paying
     * additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e–g. 601.2b If the spell is
     * modal the player announces the mode choice (see rule 700.2). If the
     * player wishes to splice any cards onto the spell (see rule 702.46), he or
     * she reveals those cards in their hand. 706.10. To copy a spell,
     * activated ability, or triggered ability means to put a copy of it onto
     * the stack; a copy of a spell isn't cast and a copy of an activated
     * ability isn't activated. A copy of a spell or ability copies both the
     * characteristics of the spell or ability and all decisions made for it,
     * including modes, targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative
     * costs. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”)

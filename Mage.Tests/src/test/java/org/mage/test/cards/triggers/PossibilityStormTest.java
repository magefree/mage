     * There's currently a bug with Possibility Storm and Zoetic Cavern. The way
     * it's supposed to work is the P. Storm trigger exiles Zoetic Cavern and
     * then uses last known information about the spell to determine the type of
     * card the trigger is looking for(creature in this instance). Instead it's
     * basing the type solely off what's printed on the card. What happened to
     * me earlier was the trigger skipped right over an Emrakul and then
     * revealed a Flooded Strand. I was prompted whether or not I wanted to
     * "cast" Flooded Strand without paying it's cost. Eventually I clicked yes
     * and it produced a Game Error that resulted in rollback. I recreated the
     * error against an AI opponent and copied the code. Can't actually post it
     * because the filter on this site claims it makes my post look too
     * "spammy". Here's a screenshot of it instead(in spoiler tag).

     * Remand's trigger revealed a Pact of Negation I chose not to cast, then the trigger for Izzet Charm
     * resolved apparently revealing a Cryptic Command. It automatically moved

     * not have a target(no spells remaining on the stack). I've seen this
     * happen with Mana Leaks that get revealed with no targets, but Cryptic
     * being modal means it should always be able to be cast. It's worth
     * mentioning that I've revealed Cryptics off triggers with other spells on
     * the stack and properly been asked if I wish to cast them. Thanks!

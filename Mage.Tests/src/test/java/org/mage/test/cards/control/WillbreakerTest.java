     * Nantuko Husk and Willbreaker without +1/+1 counters on them. The program
     * didn't let me activate the RotA, even though the creature you choose
     * doesn't need to have any counters on it (X can be 0, doesn't say
     * otherwise on the card and it isn't a target requirement). It asked me to
     * pay B, then choose a creature I controlled, which I did... and then
     * nothing happened.

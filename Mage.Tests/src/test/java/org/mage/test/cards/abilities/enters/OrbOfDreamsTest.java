/**
 * 614.12. Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield. (See rules 614.1c-d.)
 * Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a
 * general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine
 * which replacement effects apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it
 * would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified
 * how it enters the battlefield (see rule 616.1), continuous effects generated by the resolution of
 * spells or abilities that changed the permanent's characteristics on the stack (see rule 400.7a), and
 * continuous effects from the permanent's own static abilities, but ignoring continuous effects from
 * any other source that would affect it. #
 *
 * Example: Orb of Dreams is an artifact that says "Permanents enter the battlefield tapped." It won't
 * affect itself, so Orb of Dreams enters the battlefield untapped.

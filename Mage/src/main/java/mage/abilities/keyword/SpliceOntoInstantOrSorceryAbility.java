/**
 * 702.45. Splice
 * <p>
 * 702.45a Splice is a static ability that functions while a card is in your
 * hand. "Splice onto [subtype] [cost]" means "You may reveal this card from
 * your hand as you cast a [subtype] spell. If you do, copy this card's text box
 * onto that spell and pay [cost] as an additional cost to cast that spell."
 * Paying a card's splice cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in
 * rules 601.2b and 601.2e-g.
 * <p>
 * Example: Since the card with splice remains in the player's hand, it can
 * later be cast normally or spliced onto another spell. It can even be
 * discarded to pay a "discard a card" cost of the spell it's spliced onto.
 * <p>
 * 702.45b You can't choose to use a splice ability if you can't make the
 * required choices (targets, etc.) for that card's instructions. You can't
 * splice any one card onto the same spell more than once. If you're splicing
 * more than one card onto a spell, reveal them all at once and choose the order
 * in which their instructions will be followed. The instructions on the main
 * spell have to be followed first.
 * <p>
 * 702.45c The spell has the characteristics of the main spell, plus the text
 * boxes of each of the spliced cards. The spell doesn't gain any other
 * characteristics (name, mana cost, color, supertypes, card types, subtypes,
 * etc.) of the spliced cards. Text copied onto the spell that refers to a card
 * by name refers to the spell on the stack, not the card from which the text
 * was copied.
 * <p>
 * Example: Glacial Ray is a red card with splice onto Arcane that reads,
 * "Glacial Ray deals 2 damage to any target." Suppose Glacial Ray is spliced
 * onto Reach Through Mists, a blue spell. The spell is still blue, and Reach
 * Through Mists deals the damage. This means that the ability can target a
 * creature with protection from red and deal 2 damage to that creature.
 * <p>
 * 702.45d Choose targets for the added text normally (see rule 601.2c). Note
 * that a spell with one or more targets will be countered if all of its targets
 * are illegal on resolution.
 * <p>
 * 702.45e The spell loses any splice changes once it leaves the stack (for
 * example, when it's countered, it's exiled, or it resolves).
 * <p>
 * Rulings
 * <p>
 * You must reveal all of the cards you intend to splice at the same time. Each
 * individual card can only be spliced once onto a spell. If you have more than
 * one card with the same name in your hand, you may splice both of them onto
 * the spell. A card with a splice ability can't be spliced onto itself because
 * the spell is on the stack (and not in your hand) when you reveal the cards
 * you want to splice onto it. The target for a card that's spliced onto a spell
 * may be the same as the target chosen for the original spell or for another
 * spliced-on card. (A recent change to the targeting rules allows this, but
 * most other cards are unaffected by the change.) If you splice a targeted card
 * onto an untargeted spell, the entire spell will be countered if the target
 * isn't legal when the spell resolves. If you splice an untargeted card onto a
 * targeted spell, the entire spell will be countered if the target isn't legal
 * when the spell resolves. A spell is countered on resolution only if *all* of
 * its targets are illegal (or the spell is countered by an effect).

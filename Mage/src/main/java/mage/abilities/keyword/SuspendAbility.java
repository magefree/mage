/**
 *
 * 502.59. Suspend
 *
 * 502.59a Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a
 * static ability that functions while the card with suspend is in a player's
 * hand. The second and third are triggered abilities that function in the
 * removed-from-the-game zone. "Suspend N--[cost]" means "If you could play this
 * card from your hand, you may pay [cost] and remove it from the game with N
 * time counters on it. This is a special action that doesn't use the stack,"
 * and "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this card is suspended, remove a
 * time counter from it," and "When the last time counter is removed from this
 * card, if it's removed from the game, play it without paying its mana cost if
 * able. If you can't, it remains removed from the game. If you play it this way
 * and it's a creature, it gains haste until you lose control of it."
 *
 * 502.59b A card is "suspended" if it's in the removed-from-the-game zone, has
 * suspend, and has a time counter on it.
 *
 * 502.59c Playing a spell as an effect of its suspend ability follows the rules
 * for paying alternative costs in rules 409.1b and 409.1f-h.
 *
 * The phrase "if you could play this card from your hand" checks only for
 * timing restrictions and permissions. This includes both what's inherent in
 * the card's type (for example, if the card with suspend is a creature, it must
 * be your main phase and the stack must be empty) and what's imposed by other
 * abilities, such as flash or Meddling Mage's ability. Whether you could
 * actually follow all steps in playing the card is irrelevant. If the card is
 * impossible to play due to a lack of legal targets or an unpayable mana cost,
 * for example, it may still be removed from the game with suspend.
 *
 * Removing a card from the game with its suspend ability is not playing that
 * card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
 *
 * If a spell with suspend has targets, the targets are chosen when the spell is
 * played, not when it's removed from the game.
 *
 * If the first triggered ability of suspend is countered, no time counter is
 * removed. The ability will trigger again during its owner's next upkeep.
 *
 * When the last time counter is removed from a suspended card, the second
 * triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the time
 * counter was removed or whose effect removed it. (The _Time Spiral_ reminder
 * text is misleading on this point.)
 *
 * If the second triggered ability of suspend is countered, the card can't be
 * played. It remains in the removed-from-the-game zone without any time
 * counters on it for the rest of the game, and it's no longer considered
 * suspended.
 *
 * If the second triggered ability of suspend resolves, the card's owner must
 * play the spell if possible, even if that player doesn't want to. Normal
 * timing considerations for the spell are ignored (for example, if the
 * suspended card is a creature and this ability resolves during your upkeep,
 * you're able to play the card), but other play restrictions are not ignored.
 *
 * If the second triggered ability of suspend resolves and the suspended card
 * can't be played due to a lack of legal targets or a play restriction, for
 * example, it remains in the removed-from-the-game zone without any time
 * counters on it for the rest of the game, and it's no longer considered
 * suspended.
 *
 * As the second triggered ability of suspend resolves, if playing the suspended
 * card involves an additional cost, the card's owner must pay that cost if
 * able. If he or she can't, the card remains removed from the game. If the
 * additional cost includes mana, the situation is more complex. If the player
 * has enough mana in their mana pool to pay the cost, that player must do so.
 * If the player can't possibly pay the cost, the card remains removed from the
 * game. However, if the player has the means to produce enough mana to pay the
 * cost, then he or she has a choice: The player may play the spell, produce
 * mana, and pay the cost. Or the player may choose to play no mana abilities,
 * thus making the card impossible to play because the additional mana can't be
 * paid.
 *
 * A creature played via suspend comes into play with haste. It still has haste
 * after the first turn it's in play as long as the same player controls it. As
 * soon as another player takes control of it, it loses haste.

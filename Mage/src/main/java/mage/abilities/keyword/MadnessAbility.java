/**
 * 702.33. Madness
 *
 * 702.33a. Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities.
 *
 * The first is a static ability that functions while the card with madness is
 * in a player's hand. The second is a triggered ability that functions when the
 * first ability is applied.
 *
 * "Madness [cost]" means "If a player would discard this card, that player
 * discards it, but may exile it instead of putting it into his or her
 * graveyard" and "When this card is exiled this way, its owner may cast it by
 * paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn't, he or
 * she puts this card into his or her graveyard.
 *
 * 702.33b. Casting a spell using its madness ability follows the rules for
 * paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e-g.
 *
 * SOI Changes: If you discard a card with madness, you exile it instead of
 * putting it into your graveyard. Note that the mandatory discard into exile is
 * a small change from previous rules. Before, you could discard a card with
 * madness into your graveyard and skip the whole madness thing. This may be
 * relevant with cards like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy.

/**
 * Dethrone triggers whenever a creature with dethrone attacks the player with
 * the most life or tied for the most life. When the ability resolves, you put a
 * +1/+1 counter on the creature. This happens before blockers are declared.
 * Once the ability triggers, it doesn't matter what happens to anybody's life
 * total. If the defending player doesn't have the most life when the ability
 * resolves, the creature will still get the +1/+1 counter. Note that dethrone
 * won't trigger if the creature attacks a Planeswalker. You're going after the
 * crown, after all, not the royal advisors. If you have the most life, your
 * dethrone abilities won't trigger, but you may find a few choice ways to avoid
 * that situation.

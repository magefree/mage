/**
 * 20121001 702.31. Kicker 702.31a Kicker is a static ability that functions
 * while the spell with kicker is on the stack. "Kicker [cost]" means "You may
 * pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell." Paying a spell's kicker
 * cost(s) follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and
 * 601.2e-g. 702.31b The phrase "Kicker [cost 1] and/or [cost 2]" means the same
 * thing as "Kicker [cost 1], kicker [cost 2]." 702.31c Multikicker is a variant
 * of the kicker ability. "Multikicker [cost]" means "You may pay an additional
 * [cost] any number of times as you cast this spell." A multikicker cost is a
 * kicker cost. 702.31d If a spell's controller declares the intention to pay
 * any of that spell's kicker costs, that spell has been "kicked." If a spell
 * has two kicker costs or has multikicker, it may be kicked multiple times. See
 * rule 601.2b. 702.31e Objects with kicker or multikicker have additional
 * abilities that specify what happens if they are kicked. These abilities are
 * linked to the kicker or multikicker abilities printed on that object: they
 * can refer only to those specific kicker or multikicker abilities. See rule
 * 607, "Linked Abilities." 702.31f Objects with more than one kicker cost have
 * abilities that each correspond to a specific kicker cost. They contain the
 * phrases "if it was kicked with its [A] kicker" and "if it was kicked with its
 * [B] kicker," where A and B are the first and second kicker costs listed on
 * the card, respectively. Each of those abilities is linked to the appropriate
 * kicker ability. 702.31g If part of a spell's ability has its effect only if
 * that spell was kicked, and that part of the ability includes any targets, the
 * spell's controller chooses those targets only if that spell was kicked.
 * Otherwise, the spell is cast as if it did not have those targets. See rule
 * 601.2c.

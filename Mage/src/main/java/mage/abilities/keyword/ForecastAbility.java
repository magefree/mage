/**
 * 702.56. Forecast 702.56a A forecast ability is a special kind of activated
 * ability that can be activated only from a player's hand. It's written
 * "Forecast -- [Activated ability]."
 * <p>
 * 702.56b A forecast ability may be activated only during the upkeep step of
 * the card's owner and only once each turn. The controller of the forecast
 * ability reveals the card with that ability from their hand as the ability is
 * activated. That player plays with that card revealed in their hand until it
 * leaves the player's hand or until a step or phase that isn't an upkeep step
 * begins, whichever comes first.

/**
 * 702.36. Morph
 * <p>
 * 702.36a Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you
 * could play the card its on, and the morph effect works any time the card is
 * face down. "Morph [cost]" means "You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down
 * creature, with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3}
 * rather than paying its mana cost." (See rule 707, "Face-Down Spells and
 * Permanents.")
 * <p>
 * 702.36b To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down. It becomes
 * a 2/2 face-down creature card, with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no
 * mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card
 * with these characteristics (and not the face-up cards characteristics) are
 * applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that
 * object's characteristics. (See rule 613, "Interaction of Continuous Effects,"
 * and rule 706, "Copying Objects.") Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell
 * with the same characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost.
 * This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use morph to
 * cast a card from any zone from which you could normally play it. When the
 * spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the
 * spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is,
 * and it ends when the permanent is turned face up. #
 * <p>
 * 702.36c You can't cast a card face down if it doesn't have morph.
 * <p>
 * 702.36d If you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control
 * face up. This is a special action; it doesn't use the stack (see rule 115).
 * To do this, show all players what the permanents morph cost would be if it
 * were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the
 * permanent wouldn't have a morph cost if it were face up, it cant be turned
 * face up this way.) The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal
 * characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the
 * battlefield dont trigger when its turned face up and dont have any effect,
 * because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.
 * <p>
 * 702.36e See rule 707, "Face-Down Spells and Permanents," for more information
 * on how to cast cards with morph.

 *
 * 702.97. Cipher
 *
 * 702.97a Cipher appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two
 * static abilities, one that functions while the spell is on the stack and one
 * that functions while the card with cipher is in the exile zone. "Cipher"
 * means "If this spell is represented by a card, you may exile this card
 * encoded on a creature you control" and "As long as this card is encoded on
 * that creature, that creature has 'Whenever this creature deals combat damage
 * to a player, you may copy this card and you may cast the copy without paying
 * its mana cost.'"
 *
 * 702.97b The term "encoded" describes the relationship between the card with
 * cipher while in the exile zone and the creature chosen when the spell
 * represented by that card resolves.
 *
 * 702.97c The card with cipher remains encoded on the chosen creature as long
 * as the card with cipher remains exiled and the creature remains on the
 * battlefield. The card remains encoded on that object even if it changes
 * controller or stops being a creature, as long as it remains on the
 * battlefield.
 *
 * TODO: Implement Cipher as two static abilities concerning the rules.

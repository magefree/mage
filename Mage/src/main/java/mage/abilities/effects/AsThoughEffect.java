/**
 * This class functions in two steps:
 * 1. Check if the effect `applies` to a given situation using the two `.applies()` method.
 * 2. If the effect applies (because `.applies()` return true) then the corresponding `.apply()` method
 *    will be called to make any of the required changes to the state.
 * <p>
 * The `.applies()` method MUST NOT change the state of the game as they are called multiple times in the course of
 * figuring out which cards and abilities are playable.
 * <p>
 * For example. Bolas's Citadel allows you to play lands and cast spells from the top of your library.
 * Its `.applies()` method must only check if the the specified card can be played.
 * The changing of casting cost (mana to life) MUST be handled by the `.apply()` method.

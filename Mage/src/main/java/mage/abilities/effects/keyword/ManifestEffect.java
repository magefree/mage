/**
 * Manifest
 * <p>
 * 701.34a
 * To manifest a card, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes,
 * and no mana cost. Put that card onto the battlefield face down. That permanent is a manifested permanent for as
 * long as it remains face down. The effect defining its characteristics works while the card is face down and ends
 * when it’s turned face up.
 * <p>
 * 701.34b
 * Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested permanent you control face up. This is a special action
 * that doesn’t use the stack (see rule 116.2b). To do this, show all players that the card representing that
 * permanent is a creature card and what that card’s mana cost is, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up.
 * The effect defining its characteristics while it was face down ends, and it regains its normal characteristics.
 * (If the card representing that permanent isn’t a creature card or it doesn’t have a mana cost, it can’t be turned
 * face up this way.)
 * <p>
 * 701.34c TODO: need support it
 * If a card with morph is manifested, its controller may turn that card face up using either the procedure
 * described in rule 702.37e to turn a face-down permanent with morph face up or the procedure described above
 * to turn a manifested permanent face up.
 * <p>
 * 701.34d TODO: need support it
 * If a card with disguise is manifested, its controller may turn that card face up using either the procedure
 * described in rule 702.168d to turn a face-down permanent with disguise face up or the procedure described
 * above to turn a manifested permanent face up.
 * <p>
 * 701.34e TODO: need support it
 * If an effect instructs a player to manifest multiple cards from their library, those cards are manifested one at a time.
 * <p>
 * 701.34f TODO: need research, possible buggy (see face down effect order doManifestCards)
 * If an effect instructs a player to manifest a card and a rule or effect prohibits the face-down object from
 * entering the battlefield, that card isn’t manifested. Its characteristics remain unmodified and it remains in
 * its previous zone. If it was face up, it remains face up.
 * <p>
 * 701.34g TODO: need support it
 * If a manifested permanent that’s represented by an instant or sorcery card would turn face up, its controller
 * reveals it and leaves it face down. Abilities that trigger whenever a permanent is turned face up won’t trigger.

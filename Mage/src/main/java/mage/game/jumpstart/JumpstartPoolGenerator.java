  /**
   * "Jumpstart is a new way to play Magic that mashes together themes from throughout the history of the game and
   * lets you skip the deckbuilding part. Grab two boosters, shuffle them into a 40-card deck, and start playing.
   * The set contains almost 500 reprints but also introduces 37 new cards that were designed to help fill out some
   * of the themes. These are not going to be Standard-, Pioneer-, or Modern-legal cards, but are legal in Eternal
   * formats (Legacy, Vintage, Pauper and Commander). There are no foil cards in the set. 120 cards are from Core
   * Set 2021[7], and more than 400 reprints are from sets before Core Set 2021. Cards from M21 have the M21 expansion
   * symbol, while new cards and other reprints will have the Jumpstart symbol. Reprints have a Post-M15 card frame.
   * The new cards and cards with new art are numbered #1/78 to #78/78 (40 basic lands, TBA common, TBA uncommon,
   * TBA rare, and TBA mythic rare). The other reprints with the Jumpstart expansion symbol are numbered #79 to 495."
   *
   * "Jumpstart is sold in 20-card boosters, and booster boxes contain 24 boosters.[9] All 20 cards in a booster fit a
   * theme, and most themes are mono-color and have multiple variations of cards included in the pack, totaling 121
   * different possible pack contents. Special "Mythic Rare" packs don't have variations at all, but just one possible
   * card list and can feature multiple colors. What theme each booster contains is randomized. Most packs are
   * singletons, but there are some instances of having two copies of a card in the pack. All boosters contain at
   * least one rare, and one in three boosters includes an extra rare. Of the 20 cards in a pack, seven or eight
   * are lands. One basic land (or in the case of Rainbow, Terramorphic Expanse) features art that matches the pack's
   * theme. The planeswalker themed packs use the respective Showcase lands from M21, but the other packs use brand-new
   * themed land art created for the set. The booster pack is wrapped like a regular pack, but the set of cards is
   * packed in an additional plastic wrap, with a face card (the "Pack Summary card") that indicates the theme and
   * the color of the half-deck."

  /* Notes
   *
   * 1) the pools generated by this method are for how the prerelease will be played (see https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Jumpstart#Events)
   *    In order to support the 4 pack version, xmage would need to support editing multiple decks and some Duo format
   *    similar to https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Duo_Standard
   *
   * 2) this treats all packs to have similar chance to open (packs will actually be opened at a particular rarity). This
   *    could be implemented if you know the various ratios between packs by knowing the rarities from this source:
   *    https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Jumpstart#Themes_and_mechanics
   *
   * 3) this does not attempt to add an additional rare 1/3 of the time as described here:

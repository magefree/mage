         * their initial hand may take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will
         * take a mulligan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a
         * declaration, all players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan,
         * a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal
         * to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards onto the bottom of their library in
         * any order equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan. Once a player chooses not
         * to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become the player’s opening hand, and that player may not
         * take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A
         * player can’t take a number of mulligans greater their starting hand size.

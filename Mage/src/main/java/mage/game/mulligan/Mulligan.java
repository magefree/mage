         * A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may take a mulligan. First
         * the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other
         * player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all
         * players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan,
         * a player shuffles their hand back into their library, then draws a new hand of one
         * fewer cards than they had before. If a player kept their hand of cards, those cards
         * become the player’s opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans.
         * This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. (Note that if a
         * player’s hand size reaches zero cards, that player must keep that hand.)

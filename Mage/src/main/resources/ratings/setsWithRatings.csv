# this file specifies which sets have set files.
# each line must be exactly the 3 letter expansion code. this corresponds to a csv resource file in the same directory
# The <set>.csv files have a strict format:
# each line must be:
# cardname : integer rating
# each set's ratings are post-processed to have a normalized score [1..100], so the files don't need to have the same rating system.
# I created the first few files with draftaholicsanonymous but you can use any integer rating system you want

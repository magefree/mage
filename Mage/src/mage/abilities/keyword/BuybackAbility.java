/**
 * 702.25. Buyback
 *
 * 702.25a Buyback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two
 * static abilities that function while the spell is on the stack. "Buyback
 * [cost]" means "You may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell" and
 * "If the buyback cost was paid, put this spell into its owner's hand instead
 * of into that player's graveyard as it resolves." Paying a spell's buyback
 * cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and
 * 601.2e-g.

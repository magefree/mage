 *
 * 702.98. Evolve
 *
 * 702.98a Evolve is a triggered ability. "Evolve" means "Whenever a creature
 * enters the battlefield under your control, if that creature's power is
 * greater than this creature's power and/or that creature's toughness is
 * greater than this creature's toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this
 * creature."
 *
 * 702.98b If a creature has multiple instances of evolve, each triggers
 * separately
 *
 * Rulings
 *
 * When comparing the stats of the two creatures, you always compare power to
 * power and toughness to toughness. Whenever a creature enters the battlefield
 * under your control, check its power and toughness against the power and
 * toughness of the creature with evolve. If neither stat of the new creature is
 * greater, evolve won't trigger at all. For example, if you control a 2/3
 * creature with evolve and a 2/2 creature enters the battlefield under your
 * control, you won't have the opportunity to cast a spell like Giant Growth to
 * make the 2/2 creature large enough to cause evolve to trigger. If evolve
 * triggers, the stat comparison will happen again when the ability tries to
 * resolve. If neither stat of the new creature is greater, the ability will do
 * nothing. If the creature that entered the battlefield leaves the battlefield
 * before evolve tries to resolve, use its last known power and toughness to
 * compare the stats. If a creature enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters
 * on it, consider those counters when determining if evolve will trigger. For
 * example, a 1/1 creature that enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters
 * on it will cause the evolve ability of a 2/2 creature to trigger. If multiple
 * creatures enter the battlefield at the same time, evolve may trigger multiple
 * times, although the stat comparison will take place each time one of those
 * abilities tries to resolve. For example, if you control a 2/2 creature with
 * evolve and two 3/3 creatures enter the battlefield, evolve will trigger
 * twice. The first ability will resolve and put a +1/+1 counter on the creature
 * with evolve. When the second ability tries to resolve, neither the power nor
 * the toughness of the new creature is greater than that of the creature with
 * evolve, so that ability does nothing. When comparing the stats as the evolve
 * ability resolves, it's possible that the stat that's greater changes from
 * power to toughness or vice versa. If this happens, the ability will still
 * resolve and you'll put a +1/+1 counter on the creature with evolve. For
 * example, if you control a 2/2 creature with evolve and a 1/3 creature enters
 * the battlefield under your control, it toughness is greater so evolve will
 * trigger. In response, the 1/3 creature gets +2/-2. When the evolve trigger
 * tries to resolve, its power is greater. You'll put a +1/+1 counter on the
 * creature with evolve.

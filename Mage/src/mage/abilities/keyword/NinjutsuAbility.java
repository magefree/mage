/**
 * 702.47. Ninjutsu
 *
 * 702.47a Ninjutsu is an activated ability that functions only while the card
 * with ninjutsu is in a player's hand. "Ninjutsu [cost]" means "[Cost], Reveal
 * this card from your hand, Return an unblocked attacking creature you control
 * to its owner's hand: Put this card onto the battlefield from your hand tapped
 * and attacking."
 *
 * 702.47b The card with ninjutsu remains revealed from the time the ability is
 * announced until the ability leaves the stack.
 *
 * 702.47c A ninjutsu ability may be activated only while a creature on the
 * battlefield is unblocked (see rule 509.1h). The creature with ninjutsu is put
 * onto the battlefield unblocked. It will be attacking the same player or
 * planeswalker as the creature that was returned to its owner's hand.

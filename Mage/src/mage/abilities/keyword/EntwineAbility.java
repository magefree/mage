/**
 * 702.40. Entwine
 *
 * 702.40a Entwine is a static ability of modal spells (see rule 700.2) that
 * functions while the spell is on the stack. "Entwine [cost]" means "You may
 * choose all modes of this spell instead of just one. If you do, you pay an
 * additional [cost]." Using the entwine ability follows the rules for choosing
 * modes and paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e-g.
 *
 * 702.40b If the entwine cost was paid, follow the text of each of the modes in
 * the order written on the card when the spell resolves.

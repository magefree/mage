    // a playerÂ’s maximum hand size, or say that a creature must attack this turn if able. These effects
    // are applied after all other continuous effects have been applied. Continuous effects that affect
    // the costs of spells or abilities are applied according to the order specified in rule 601.2e.
    // All other such effects are applied in timestamp order. See also the rules for timestamp order
    // and dependency (rules 613.6 and 613.7).
    // Some of this rule modifying effects are implemented as normal CONTINUOUS effects using the Layer.RulesEffects.
    // But if the rule change can be implemented simply by preventing an event from happening, CONTINUOUS_RULE_MODIFICATION effects can be used.
    // They work technical like a replacement effect that replaces the event completely.
    // But player isn't asked to choose order of effects if multiple are applied to the same event.

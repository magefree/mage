There are another way to report bugs too:
* Feedback from xmage app's main menu;
* Bug thread in the [Official XMage forum](http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=70).  

## Installation / running

* Download [latest XMage launcher file](http://xmage.de) and put it to any folder like `D:\games\xmage`;
* You need to have [Java version 8 or later](http://java.com/) to run launcher;
* If you can't run it then create `run-LAUNCHER.cmd` text file in launcher folder and put that line to it and save as ANSI format:
  * `java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar XMageLauncher-0.3.8.jar`
  * or just [downlod and unpack that archive](http://xmage.today/X/run.zip) to launcher folder.

[Wiki page](https://github.com/magefree/mage/wiki) contains detail information about private or public server setup.

### Server options

The XMage server locates by default the configuration file from the current working directory to the relative path `config/config.xml`
(`config\config.xml` in Windows). To change this location, start the server with the property `xmage.config.path` set
to the desired location, for example `-Dxmage.config.path=config/otherconfig.xml`. The option can be set from the 
XMageLauncher in `Settings > Java > Server java options`.

## Performance tweaks

If you have a good GPU, it's very likely you'll be able increase performance by **a lot** through extra Java flags.

XMage runs on JRE 8, so [this link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html) should give you the available flags.

### How to enable the extra flags

1. Launch XMage
2. In the menu bar from the launcher, click on "Settings", which will open up the Settings Window
3. Go to the "Java" tab
4. You can pass extra flags by editing the "Client java options" text field

### Linux tweaks

#### Enable OpenGL

More info about [OpenGL](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html#opengl):
* `-Dsun.java2d.opengl=true`

Possible problems:
* _**Caveat**_: [There's a bug](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6545140) with the file chooser when OpenGL is enabled (you use the file chooser when you, for instance, try to load a deck from disk). The [suggested workaround](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6439320) will make the game crash, so it's not an option.
* _**Workaround**_: When using [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3), you're able to work around the bug by toggling the "floating" capabilities of the window and forcing it to re-render.

#### Enable XRender

More info about [XRender](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html#xrender):
* `-Dsun.java2d.xrender=true`

#### Increase memory usage

This is not guaranteed to yield improvements, but it depends on your use-case. 
If you have a lot of RAM to spare, you might as well increase the initial heap size for good measure.
More details about [memory settings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57839720/8401696):
* `-Xms1G -Xmx2G`

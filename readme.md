XMage allows you to play Magic against one or more online players or computer opponents. 
It includes full rules enforcement for over **25 000** unique cards and more than 65 000 reprints from different editions. 
You can also find custom sets like Star Wars. All regular sets have nearly all implemented cards.

It supports single matches and tournaments with dozens of game modes like duel, multiplayer, standard, modern, commander, 
pauper, oathbreaker, historic, freeform, richman and much more.

Local server supports a [special test mode](https://github.com/magefree/mage/wiki/Development-Testing-Tools) for 
testing combos and other game situations with pre-defined conditions.

There are [public servers](http://xmage.today/servers/) where you can play XMage against other players. 
You can also host your own server to play against the AI and/or your friends.

## Installation / running

* Download [latest XMage launcher and app files](http://xmage.today/) and un-pack it to any folder like `D:\games\xmage`;
* You need to have [Java version 8 or later](http://java.com/) to run launcher.
  
[Wiki page](https://github.com/magefree/mage/wiki) contains detail information about private or public server setup.

### Server options

The XMage server locates by default the configuration file from the current working directory to the relative path `config/config.xml`
(`config\config.xml` in Windows). To change this location, start the server with the property `xmage.config.path` set
to the desired location, for example `-Dxmage.config.path=config/otherconfig.xml`. The option can be set from the 
XMageLauncher in `Settings > Java > Server java options`.

## Performance tweaks

If you have a good GPU, it's very likely you'll be able to increase performance by **a lot** through extra Java flags.

XMage runs on JRE 8, so [this link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html) should give you the available flags.

### How to enable the extra flags

1. Launch XMage
2. In the menu bar from the launcher, click on "Settings", which will open up the Settings Window
3. Go to the "Java" tab
4. You can pass extra flags by editing the "Client java options" text field

### Linux tweaks

#### Enable OpenGL

More info about [OpenGL](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html#opengl):
* `-Dsun.java2d.opengl=true`

Possible problems:
* _**Caveat**_: [There's a bug](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6545140) with the file chooser when OpenGL is enabled (you use the file chooser when you, for instance, try to load a deck from disk). The [suggested workaround](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6439320) will make the game crash, so it's not an option.
* _**Workaround**_: When using [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3), you're able to work around the bug by toggling the "floating" capabilities of the window and forcing it to re-render.

#### Enable XRender

More info about [XRender](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html#xrender):
* `-Dsun.java2d.xrender=true`

#### Increase memory usage

This is not guaranteed to yield improvements, but it depends on your use-case. 
If you have a lot of RAM to spare, you can increase the initial heap size for good measure.
More details about [memory settings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57839720/8401696):
* `-Xms1G -Xmx2G`

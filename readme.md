# XMage - Magic, Another Game Engine

XMage allows you to play magic against one or more online players or computer opponents. It includes full rules enforcement for over **10,000** unique cards (nearly 20.000 counting all cards from different editions). Starting with Eventide, all regular sets have nearly all the cards implemented ([see here in detail which cards are implemented](http://ct-magefree.rhcloud.com/stats)).

There are public servers where you can play XMage against other players. Apart from this, you can also host your own server to play against the AI and/or your friends.

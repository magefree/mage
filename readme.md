XMage allows you to play Magic against one or more online players or computer opponents. It includes full rules enforcement for over **17.200** unique cards (over 33.100 counting all cards from different editions). Starting with *Morningtide*, all regular sets have nearly all the cards implemented. A more detailed information which cards are implemented can be found [here](https://github.com/magefree/mage/wiki/Set-implementation-list).

There are public servers where you can play XMage against other players. You can also host your own server to play against the AI and/or your friends.
